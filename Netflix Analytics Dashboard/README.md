# Netflix Analytics Dashboard using Tableau Public

Here I have grabbed Netflix dataset from Kaggle, dived into Tableau ðŸ“Šâœ¨, unveiled insights and started weaving the dashboard through visualizations. 

## The dashboard provides an interface to the user: 
1. To search for any Movie or a TV Show to get the Release Year, Rating, Date Added, Duration, Cast, Genre, and Description respectively.
2. To create all the dynamic visuals according to user's choice on Movie or a TV Show.
3. To view the total number of Movies and TV Shows in each Country.
4. To view the total number of Movies and TV Shows released each year.
5. To display top genres by using a dynamic parameter.
6. To know the percentage distribution of total Movies and TV Shows.
7. To get Total Ratings for Movies and TV Shows

## The following are the skills that I have strengthened while doing this Dashboard:
1) Full and proper understanding of raw data given
2) Data cleaning and ETL process
3) Created Calculated Field and Parameter.
4) Created dashboard using different visuals
5) Getting insights of the whole Netflix Dataset on both Movies and TV Shows.
