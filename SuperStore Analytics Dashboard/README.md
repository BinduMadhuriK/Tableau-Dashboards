#Project: SuperStore Analytics Dashboard.

Here I am going to consider the Superstore Sales dataset(from Kaggle) to build analysis in TABLEAU in order to draw some meaningful insights, so that it can add value to the business. 

About the Dataset:
This data is about the Superstore sales, profit, quantity and Discount dealing in various categories of products which are further divided into various subcategories. 


Some Key insights/KPIs of given Dashboard are following:
1. The dashboard displays the total number of Sales, Profit, Quantity and Discount for the orders sold so far. 
2. The dashboard has dynamic visuals with various graphing styles including: line chart, bar chart , bubble chart, stacked bars, heat map, pie chart, and a map. 
3. The Dashboard allows the user to enter the range of order date filter of products to know the insights of Total Sales, Profit, Quantity and Discount of the orders, Monthly and Yearly profits, Category-wise or Segment-wise or Ship Mode-wise Profit, State-wise Pofit, Year-wise Weekend & Weekday Profit Percentage, Day-wise Sub-category Sales & Profit and Top States which has highest number of profits in that particular range of order date.

Analysis on visuals:
1. We get layers upon layers of information in these different graphing styles. For example, Select a Chart Type (Line chart or bar chart or bubble chart) to get the month and year-wise maximum and minimum profit. So, for the overall data, in the month of December 2016, it has a great amount profit of around 17.8k and in the month of January 2014, it has a loss of 3.2k.
2. The pie chart illustrates the Category-wise or Segment-wise or Ship Mode-wise Profit percentage of total. Select any dimension from the dropdown to know more. For example, for the Category-wise Profit, somewhere around 50% of the profit has been contributed from Technolgy sector.
3. Heat Map depicts the Day-wise Subcategory sales and profit. Darker the color, highest the profit and bigger the size, highest the sales. For example, Copiers has made highest profit of around 18.7k with 46k sales on Sunday but Phones has made profit of around 8k with 59.7k sales on Sunday.
4. Stacked bar gives Year-wise Weekend & Weekday Profit Percentage. In the Year 2017, weekdays contribute highest profit around 21% and in the year 2016, weekends contribute highest profit around 12%
5. Horizontal bar graph(with profit parameter) and map gives top states by profit. Overall, California has highest no. of profits with 76.3k.
